# Neuro-fuzzy

## Description
Neuro-fuzzy is a repository focused on implementing Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for two distinct applications: Capacitive Deionization and Power Prediction. 

### Capacitive Deionization Example
The Capacitive Deionization example utilizes data with voltage (V), concentrate (ppm), feed rate (ml/min), and electrical conductivity (EC) as input parameters, and Desalination (%) as the output. This ANFIS model aims to predict the desalination percentage based on the provided input data, demonstrating the versatility of neuro-fuzzy systems in water treatment applications.

### Power Prediction Example
The Power Prediction example focuses on predicting power consumption using previous values of power and energy. By employing ANFIS, this model forecasts power requirements based on historical data, showcasing the potential of neuro-fuzzy systems in energy forecasting and optimization.
